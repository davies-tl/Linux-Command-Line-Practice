Tacoma Chamber of Commerce

510 Shoreline Vista, Suite 1103

Tacoma, WA 98402 


Dear Deborah:

Recently, you contacted our staff about the Chamber's decision to sponsor a job fair
again this year. We are interested in participating as we have done in the past.

Please send us the information about the date and location for this year's fair. If a map
of the exhibit area is available, we would appreciate receiving a copy of it. Also, please
send us a name and address of someone we can contact regarding the on-site physical 
facilities. Specifically, we need to know what size the exhibit booths are and how we
can reserve one.

Thank you for your help in this matter. We look forward to participating in the job fair
and hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely yours,


Tyler Davies
