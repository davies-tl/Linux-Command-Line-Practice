Whither, 'midst falling dew,
   While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
   Far through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
   thy solitary way?
Vainly the fowler's eye
   Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong, As,
   darkly painted on the crimson sky
   thy figure floats along.
Seek'st thou the plashy brink
   Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
   Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
   On the chafed ocean's side?
========================================================
He who, from zone to zone,
   Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
   In the long way that I must tread alone,
   Will lead my steps aright.
========================================================
4:   thy solitary way?
6:   Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong, As,
8:   thy figure floats along.
14:   Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,
17:All day thy wings have fanned,
23:   And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,
24:   Soon, o'er thy sheltered nest.
26:   Hath swallowed up thy form; yet on my heart
30:   Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,
