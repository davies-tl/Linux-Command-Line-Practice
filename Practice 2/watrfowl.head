Whither, 'midst falling dew,
   While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
   Far through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue
   thy solitary way?
Vainly the fowler's eye
   Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong, As,
   darkly painted on the crimson sky
   thy figure floats along.
Seek'st thou the plashy brink
   Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,
   Or where the rocking billows rise and sink
   On the chafed ocean's side?
