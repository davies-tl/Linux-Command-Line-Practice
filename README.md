# Linux-Comand-Line-Practice

This repository has a number of folders which contain linux shell command practice. Each will have a file starting with "cmds" which shows the commands used, and the other text files in each folder are the output that would result from those commands. If need be, each file will have an additional README.md file with further notes.
